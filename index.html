# My First Portfolio

This is my first website for a class project. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a simple page about me.

***

### What it has:
* A part about me, my projects, and how to contact me.
* A button to change the theme from light to dark.
* A welcome message when you open the page.
* It also says "Good Morning" or "Good Afternoon" depending on the time.

***

### How to open it:

1.  Download all the files.
2.  Find the `index.html` file and open it in a browser like Chrome.

***

### How I used AI:

I used ChatGPT and Gemini to help me with this project. I used them when I got stuck to:

* Help fix bugs in my code.
* Show me the right way to write some code.
* Give me some picture ideas for my projects.
